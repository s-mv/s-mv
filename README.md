I'm working on making stuff to present on GitHub ~~as I love to show off~~ and am trying to find fun and challenging ideas.
## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:  
I am learning C++ right now, it's easier to pick up since I've been coding for a while now.
## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
I'd love to work on projects related to game development, I've been using Godot since 2020 and have made some games from scratch in JS before that. I like to think of innovative ideas for making games or interesting algorithms.
## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:  
JavaScript, I know quite a bit of JavaScript.
## ðŸ“« How to reach me:

## ðŸ˜„ Pronouns:  
I prefer he/him but you may use _lord/king_. /j
## âš¡ Fun fact:  
A small percentage of the static you see on "dead" TV stations is left over radiation from the Big Bang. You're seeing residual effects of the universe's creation.
